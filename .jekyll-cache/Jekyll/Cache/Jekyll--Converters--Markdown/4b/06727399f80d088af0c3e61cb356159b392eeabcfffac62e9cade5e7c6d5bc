<!-- My research in **human-computer interaction** and **information visualization** spans many application domains, from visualizing personal sensing data to studying biases with visualizations. My particular interests are in **designing effective strategies to mitigate biases and improve decision-making in visualization and expanding visualization usage contexts by creating effective visualizations for mobile devices and personal data.** 
I am also interested in initiatives towards advancing open practices and transparency in research. I have organized a [panel on transparency in qualitative research in humanâ€“computer interaction](https://osf.io/auhpd) and contributed to the [ACM CHI conference reviewing guidelines](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5566172). I believe that open practices, such as, transparent reporting of the research process and data sharing, are not only important for establishing the rigor and validity of empirical studies but can also provide invaluable guidance to students and beginners starting out in the field.  

### Mitigating Biases With Visualizations

Biases associated with visualizations can be categorized into three typesâ€”perceptual biases, cognitive biases, and implicit or social biases. Perceptual biases are those where how we see data distorts our judgments, cognitive biases refer to flawed reasoning occurring during decision-making, and social or implicit biases refer to unconscious, ingrained attitudes and stereotypes about groups of people. I focus on studying cognitive and implicit biases in visualization (although perceptual biases are invariably at play when using visualizations and can be difficult to delineate).
