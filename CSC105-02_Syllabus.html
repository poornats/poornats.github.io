    <a name="courseSummary">
        <h2>Course Summary</h2>
        CSC 105 is an introductory course in computer science, focusing on
        the theme of playing and making games. If you enjoy games <em>of any sort</em>:
        board games, video games, card games, etc., then this course
        will show you how to make your own.

        <p>
            At its core, this course is about <strong>how computer scientists
                think about and solve problems</strong>. So if you're thinking about
            a CS major or minor, this will give you a solid foundation.
            And if you're here just because
            you're curious, well, that's great since games are fun!
        </p>

        <p>
            By the end of the course, you should be
            able to do the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>understand and write in the Python programming language in order to
                create functional programs that either implement or simulate playing games</li>
            <li>practice good debugging skills</li>
            <li>write algorithms in <em>pseudocode</em> that will successfully solve a problem</li>
            <li>understand how the computer represents and processes information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We will cover the following topics (at minimum):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>functions</li>
            <li>variables</li>
            <li>assignment</li>
            <li>conditionals</li>
            <li>loops</li>
            <li>recursion</li>
            <li>lists/arrays</li>
            <li>file reading/writing</li>
            <li>binary numbers and ASCII</li>
            <li>strings and string methods</li>
            <li>dictionaries</li>
        </ul>
    </a>

    <a name="prerequisites">
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        None! Well, there is one: a desire to work, learn, and get involved!
        No previous computer programming experience is required.
    </a>

    <a name="hardwareSoftware">
        <h2>Hardware/Software</h2>
        <p>
            You will need one bit of hardware: a USB flash drive (thumb drive) that you can store your work on. Please
            bring it to class every day. They are available in most stores, including our own bookstore.
        </p>

        <p>
            In class, you are required to use our lab iMacs.
            However, when working on your projects outside of class, you have a choice.
            If you'd like to continue using our iMacs, feel free! We have three
            spaces that you can use:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Pasta lab (N104 in the Science &amp; Engineering building)</li>
            <li>CS Resource room (Steinmetz Hall, 209A, just down the hall from my office)</li>
            <li>Olin 107, where we have class</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        All of these labs are available to you 24/7 using your ID card, except when classes
        are being held in them. If you'd rather work on your own computer, that's
        ok too, but you'll need to download some free software:

    </a>

    <a name="evaluation">
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><u>Exams</u></strong> There is 1 midterm and a final exam.
                The midterm is on TBD.
                Exams are cumulative, closed book, and limited notes. You may bring
                one single-sided page of notes to the midterm and two single-sided
                pages of notes to the final.
                If you cannot be at an exam for a <strong>good</strong> reason (illness, for
                example)
                then please let me know so we can make other arrangements.
                The final will be cumulative. On exams, you will be responsible
                for all material covered in the readings and in lectures.
            </li>

            <p>
            </p>
            <li><strong><u>Programming projects</u></strong> Programming
                projects will be assigned throughout the term to reinforce
                the concepts discussed in class. Projects are due at the
                <u>start</u>
                of class on the day it is due.
                <strong>No lates will be accepted.</strong>
                You must turn in <strong>both</strong> a hard copy (on paper) and an electronic copy (on
                <a href="http://nexus.union.edu/">Nexus</a>). Your assignment is not
                turned in unless you give me both.
            </li>

            <p>
            </p>
            <li><strong><u>In-Class Exercises (ICEs)</u></strong> We will often
                have hands-on computer time during class so you can practice things
                first-hand. This is especially true on Tuesdays, when our class
                is a little longer. I will occasionally have you turn in your
                ICE for credit, either on that day or at the next class. You should
                turn in ICEs the same way as programming projects: on paper and on
                <a href="http://nexus.union.edu/">Nexus</a>.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <!--
<p>
</p><li>
<a href="http://www.turingscraft.com/go.html"><strong><u>CodeLab</u></strong></a> 
This is a Web-based set of
exercises that will be assigned sporadically throughout the term.
It will grade your submissions instantaneously, and you can keep
submitting answers until you get it right. This is good way to
practice the syntax and logic of Python, the language we'll be
using in this course.
</li>
-->
            <p>
            </p>
            <li><strong><u>Microquizzes</u></strong> There will be a 1-point
                closed-book, closed-notes quiz at the start of each class.
                You can miss 4 of these
                quizzes without penalty. <em>You won't be allowed to take the
                    microquiz if you enter class after I've finished passing it out.</em>
                You may not make up a missed microquiz.
                <p></p>

                <p>
                    The point of these is not busy-work. I hate busy-work.
                    But in computer science,
                    we start with simple things and build on them and combine them
                    into more and more complex ideas. It is important that you don't
                    fall behind. Microquizzes, ICEs,
                    etc. are
                    there to motivate you to review material <em>regularly</em> and
                    to keep up. If you feel
                    at any point that something is not quite clear to you, it's your job
                    to come see me so that we can clarify that issue before we get to
                    something more complex that builds on it.
                </p>
            </li>

            <!--
<li><strong><u>Voluntary Participation</u></strong> You'll get the most out of
this class by getting involved!  Whether it be giving an opinion during
a discussion, trying to answer a programming question, or just speaking up
if I make a mistake on the board, this whole education thing only works if
you're an active participant in it.
</li>

    <a name="academicDishonesty">
        <h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2>
        Struggling <strong>on your own</strong> to figure out what to type next is where a lot of the learning
        happens in CS. Give yourself the opportunity to do this -- ALONE. Here are some specific things to avoid
        (this is not a complete list):

        <ul>
            <li>
                Do not "work on the project together" with friends, especially if each of you
                is at your own computer and are always in lock step trying to figure out the same
                line or section of code at the same time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not give your
                code to another person or receive code from another person -- EVER.
                You might think that it's just helping out a friend, but it's still
                plagiarism.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not even <em>look</em> at someone else's code unless it is to
                <strong>give</strong> that other person help. For example, if someone asks you
                to look at their code in order to understand an error message, that's fine.
                If you are looking because you yourself don't know how to write something and
                you need "inspiration", that's NOT fine.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Ok, so what <strong>should</strong> you do? Here are some tips:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Once you've struggled with something on your own and you're still getting nowhere, ask for help!
                Email and visit me, go to the helpdesk, and, yes, ask your fellow students! They can't show
                you code, but they can sure explain things and write out examples.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's ok to write pseudocode together. Get the logic down in English. Then go off
                by yourself and translate it to code.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's ok to read and write code together that is not part of the assignment, especially when it
                helps demonstrate the concept of what you're being
                asked to do. Go through a class example together or maybe a demo. There's no better
                way to understand something than trying to think up examples in order to teach it to someone else.
                Try it!
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You're going to write and see a lot of code in this class. A good
            question is: what sources can you legally take code from for your
            projects?
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>

        <h3>It is ok to reuse code...</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>that I hand out in class</li>
            <li>that is part of a demo that I leave on <a href="http://nexus.union.edu/">Nexus</a></li>
            <li>that I give you (or that you write) as part of an ICE or past project
            </li>
            <li>that is in the textbook that we use for this course</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>It is NOT ok to reuse code...</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>that is part of someone else's ICE or project</li>
            <li>that is on the Web/Internet</li>
            <li>that is in other textbooks</li>
        </ul>

        Here's the bottom line: <strong>except for the above, you have to write all the
            code yourself, from scratch.</strong>
        In all cases, you must <strong>explicitly cite</strong> any source
        (like a web page tutorial or a helpdesk person) that you use to help
        complete an assignment. Again, this is similar to writing an English
        paper;
        if you use a quote or material from someone else,
        you have to give credit where credit is due. Otherwise you are
        inappropriately plagiarizing or borrowing ideas. You do not have
        to cite help from me.

        <p>
            We have an honor code now and I trust y'all to follow it.
            Read up on it at
            <a href="http://honorcode.union.edu/" target="_blank">http://honorcode.union.edu</a>. All suspected
            violations will be reported to the Honor Council chair and Dean
            of Studies.

    <a name="preparingForClass">
        <h2>Preparing for the Class</h2>

        To prepare for class, you are required to do the following:
        <ul>
            <h3>Show up</h3>
            You are expected to be present for every class. However, I realize that
            sometimes other things come up (interview, illness, etc.) so
            just please let me know in advance by phone/email if you're going to be absent.
            <!--  Unexcused absences are NOT allowed and will
            affect your grade. If you miss class, get notes from someone
            and do the readings before coming to see me. I'm happy to
            explain things, but I won't repeat lectures for you. -->

            <h3>Read the text</h3>
            Lectures will primarily follow the major topics covered by the text.
            You should do the reading for that week <i>before</i> coming to class so
            that questions you have about the material can be answered during
            lecture.
            There will always be a time for questions about the readings or previous
            lectures at the beginning of class. Take advantage of it.

            <h3>Check the webpage on <a href="http://nexus.union.edu/">Nexus</a></h3>
            The reading assignments (and other announcements) will be
            posted regularly on the course webpage. You are required
            to check it at least once a week. I usually update it over the weekend.

            <h3>Check your email/Slack </h3>
            I send out
            a lot of tips, hints, announcements, error corrections, and
            lecture addendums over email/Slack. Check it at least twice daily.

            <h3>Stay focused</h3>
            Class time will be a "hands-on" computing environment. There will
            be lots of time to practice with various demos that I'll provide.
            But class time is for class work. Using the computers for other things like
            other classes' work, checking Facebook, reading email, or catching the latest ESPN
            highlight video is not permitted. This policy extends to cell and smart phones too.
            Phones should be in silent mode and out of sight. You are invited to
            "turn in" your phone at the start of class in order to be free of distraction.
            <p>
                Class goes by quick. Stay focused.
                If you're done with a demo, don't allow yourself to get bored. Extend the demo. Or help out your
                neighbor.
            </p>

            <h3>Make backups</h3>
            Make backups
            of everything either by saving it on a USB flash drive or
            storing it on your <em>orzo</em> account.

            <h3>Practice, practice, practice!</h3>
            This is first and foremost a programming course so you'll be
            putting in a lot of time writing, testing, and rewriting code. There's
            no other way of getting better at it than by putting in the effort.
        </ul>

    <a name="accommodations">
        <h2>Accommodations</h2>
        Union College facilitates the implementation of reasonable accommodations, including
        resources and services, for students with disabilities, chronic medical conditions and temporary
        disabilities resulting in difficulties accessing learning opportunities. All students needing services must
        first register with Accommodative Services located in Reamer 303. It is strongly recommended that
        accommodations be requested within the first two weeks of the term. Last minute requests can be denied.
        Any student with a documented learning disorder is welcome to
        come talk to me privately about options for completion of exams and
        homework assignments.
    </a>

    <a name="theBottomLine">
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <b>Ask questions and seek help.</b> This is the most important
        point of all. I live to answer questions. Don't be afraid to
        come to my office every single day if you want. It's better
        for everybody (you AND me) if you understand
        things sooner rather than later. More often than not, there's
        a line of people waiting to see me on the day before a project
        is due. You'll get the help you need faster by starting on projects
        sooner rather than waiting until the last minute.
